[The interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjPH9njnaVU)


I can't help it, but I like this kind of people.

Strangely, [many people laugh at them](https://www.reddit.com/r/KafkaFPS/comments/1lx4g1v/дуров_раскрыл_секрет_полного_потенциала_и_ясного/), but I don't really know the reason. Maybe it is just envy?

> I never had a phone

I actually agree with this. I have bought a cheap used phone for 20 dollars. It is a Samsung galaxy A50, 3GB ram.

Theoretically, there does not exist an app(not game) that cannot be launched on this thing. It runs modern Android, and 32 GB of memory is enough if you don't do photography. 

But as you can guess, it is extremely slow. Even a simple unlocking on can take as much as 5 seconds.

Yet that is the point. Is it very unappealing to use this glowing rectangle. You get bored.


I also own a Samsung watch, that costs ten times as much. The only reason I can [afford](attention is your scarcest resource benkuhn) it, is because it does not have a media feed, no matter how funny it sounds. I use it to take calls, because, society. Also, alarms, biking, setting timers, and getting the weather.

I don't get them very often, I try to opt-out from them when possible, but there are just moments sometimes when you need it

This way my phone+watch screen time is about 20 minutes a day, which is pretty good.

Actually, I have tried quite a lot of things to get there. There were attempts to make a habit of not using the phone, multiple screen blockers, writing accountability scripts, but none of that helped - i was just too impulsive and forgetful.

JVScholz on youtube and guzey.com/productivity both helped somehow here.

But let's continue with the interview.

> I try to allocate as much time as possible for... sleep!
> Even if I allocate, say 11-12 hours for sleep - i wont sleep for 11 or 12 hours.. thinking! And some people hate it. They say: "you should take a sleeping pill", but I never take pills. I like those moments. I get so many brilliant ideas. Sometimes, late in the evening, or early in the morning. That's my favorite time of day.

Here i understand, that the laptop became the same thing as the phone was for me before. And i need to do something with that very soon.

See [[Sleep]] for my experience.

Yet I have never managed to just lie in the bed for hours. I had always gotten an idea that i needed to write somewhere, so I opened Telegram to save it, then i checked the feed, then i went to RSS, completely forgetting the original intention to go to sleep earlier. And then 3 hours might pass.

It is terrible, and no better now. I need to do something with it.


> If you open your phone first thing in the morning, what you end up being is a creature that is told what to think about for the rest of the day.

That is quite a bold quote, I have added it to anki

> I founded one of the largest social networks in the world, after which i founded the second largest messaging app in the world, and... you're supposed to be really connected. 

HAHAHA
That is really the case when the dealer does not consume the product.

> But the conclusion you reach very early, is the more connected and accessible you are, the less productive you are.

> Most of information is irrelevant to the success.

[[Where do I get the news]] - an article about RSS, tg, and how did I come to that.

I dont really think that i need to reduce my consumption of information any further. There is RSS, and i really think that I should keep it. Perhaps reduce, but keep in general.


> One of the reasons I never had a depression is that I start doing things. I identify the problem, i can see the solution, and I start executing the strategy. If you are stuck in this loop of being worried about something, nothing's ever going to change.
Eliezer yudkowski has actually [written about this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9o3QBg2xJXcRCxGjS/working-hurts-less-than-procrastinating-we-fear-the-twinge)

This is exactly what I have with my BIOCAD problem right now. 

And many different things in life as well.

Getting out of the loop, doing the hard thing, staring into the void, stopping to be weak, starting to stand on nails, running every fucking morning, becoming stronger - this is the only way to get something done in life. And anki, and foxford, and olympiads - all of that. Sleep

I need to publish that and commit. And post daily reviews of what did i do that or another day.

TODO: Make a commitment.md and, well, commit.


Continuing:

> And people often make this mistake, thinking "Oh, I should just have some rest and then regain energy"
21:51

And here I went to sleep, as always these days -at 3 am. 
But today, I have put my laptop on my bookshelf, not to use it in the morning.
