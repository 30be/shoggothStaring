Hi. My name is Luka.

I am passionate about programming, reading [blogs](rss), [meditation](meditation), and skiing.

I have programming experience in the following languages:

- C/C++ (Vulkan, OpenGL, WinAPI, SDL2)
- Haskell (Hakyll, base)
- Python (pytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Javascript (React, Nodejs, Express.js, three.js, Rollup(Webpack))

I also know Kotlin, SQL, Lua, and Bash, but I don't have much experience with them.

I use Linux (Arch) and can administer it at a basic level.

My verifiable achievements include:

- 1st place at the Kolmogorov Readings (2023) - I was the lead developer of a team writing a [3D graphics engine in Vulkan](cgsg).
- a prize at the regional stage of the All-Russian School Olympiad in programming (2024).

My German is B2, English is C1, and I have a 300-day Japanese streak on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/deeeear).

Having left [school](school) in the 10th grade, I continue to study every day online, using Wikipedia, [Anki](srs), and Foxford.

My worldview largely aligns with [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com/) and the Bay Area in general. Although I have never been there physically, my spirit lives there.
