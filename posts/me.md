Hi. My name is Luka.

I am passionate about programming, reading [blogs](http://23.94.5.170:8080), meditation, and skiing.

I have programming experience in the following languages:

- C/C++ (Vulkan, OpenGL, WinAPI, SDL2)
- Haskell (Hakyll, base)
- Python (pytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Javascript (React, Nodejs, Express.js, three.js, Rollup(Webpack))

I use Linux (Arch) and can administer it at a basic level. The general coding style I try to adhere to can be described by [grug](https://grugbrain.dev/).

My verifiable achievements include:

- 1st place at the Kolmogorov Readings (2023) - I was a lead developer of a team writing a 3D graphics engine in Vulkan
- a prize at the regional stage of the All-Russian School Olympiad in programming (2024).

My German is B2, English is C1, and I have a 300-day Japanese streak on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/deeeear). I use [Anki](srs) to continuously improve.

My worldview largely aligns with [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com/) and the Bay Area in general. Although I have never been there physically, my spirit lives there.

It loads slowly and is best viewed on a PC.
Inside, you'll find a 3D engine where you can ride a bicycle with a waving flag, featuring tens of thousands of cows with wings, a Mandelbrot fractal in the sky, and customizable controls.

#### [Web raymarching system (Online)](https://30be.github.io/SUM2024/WebRaymarching/)

[![raymarching](raymarching.png){width=30%}](raymarching.png)
A system for drawing 3D graphics using the ray marching algorithm on the web with GPU acceleration and dynamic shader creation.

#### [Multieditor (Online)](https://30be.github.io/MultiEditor/output/index.html)

[![multieditor](multieditor.png){width=30%}](multieditor.png)
An unfinished project for viewing objects, textures, and materials of a user's 3D model.
Written in collaboration with [tim2303](https://github.com/tim2303/), using React and Three.js.

MNIST classifier from scratch. Backpropagation, [online learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning),  console interface.

#### OpenGL renderer

[![OpenGL renderer](T06ANIM.png){width=30%}](T06ANIM.png)
A real-time 3D engine written from scratch in C++ with deferred lighting, transparency, multi-texturing, and animation (DAE/Collada, forward kinematics).

#### CPU Raytracer

[![CPU Raytracer](T05RT.png){width=30%}](T05RT.png)
A parallel renderer with support for transparency, materials, complex objects, and loading models with textures.

#### [textbook-rss](https://github.com/30be/TextbookRSS)

A small Python project that allows generating an RSS feed for any book.
