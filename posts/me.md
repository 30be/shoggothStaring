I have a strong interest in computer science and math, with experience in C++, OpenGL, Vulkan, JavaScript, Python, Haskell.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading science fiction self-improving, skiing, watching YouTube, and studying, of course. I am currently learning German and Japanese, my username in Duolingo is ```deeear```. Digital minimalism is the way, so I try not to use the phone much.

I am most inspired by [[cool-people.md|these people]].(Basically, rationalist writers)
My RSS aggregator and subscription list can be found [here](http://23.94.5.170:8080).

I find the problem of the AI emergence in the following 5 years highly underrated by the public. You cannot make reliable plans without taking much of the evidence from the fact that the world will change very soon.

*And I want to become a cyborg*
