This is a page about my site. If you're looking for me, see [/me](me)

The site compiler is based on the Haskell static site framework, Hakyll. It is just a couple of hundred lines of code, all in [one file](https://github.com/30be/shoggothStaring/blob/main/main.hs). Feel free to improve it.

To write my posts, I use markdown. To see the page source, you can append ".md" to the URL you're on. For example, <https://shoggothStaring.com/about.md>

All HTML is also written in Haskell EDSL.

Life is too short to write CSS, so I chose [sakura.css](https://oxal.org/projects/sakura/).

The search is implemented as a Javascript file [search.js](search.js).
