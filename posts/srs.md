Above is a heatmap of my Anki usage. It is updated in real time. I know, it is very far from perfect, and that there are more days skipped than not, but I will try to improve that in the future.

This way, I publicly commit: I, LS4, will never skip a day of Anki practice from 11th October 2025 until the environment requires me to do so.

By skipping, I mean not completing 100 new cards a day in the usual Anki study mode, which randomly mixes known cards with the new ones.

By environment requirement, I mean a physical inability to practice on the day, or a special permission written here by my past self - like for important exam days.
